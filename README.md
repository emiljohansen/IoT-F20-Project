# Content of the repository
The 'evaluation'-folder holds all scripts and raw data in .csv-files used for evaluation, in addition to a jupyter notebook file for plotting the data.

In the 'root' the script running on the Pycom can be seen in main.py, and the 'lib'-folder contains any external libraries used on it.
